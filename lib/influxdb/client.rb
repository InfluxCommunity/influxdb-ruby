    # === Examples:
    #
    #  # connect to localhost using root/root
    #  # as the credentials and doesn't connect to a db
    #
    #  InfluxDB::Client.new
    #
    #  # connect to localhost using root/root
    #  # as the credentials and 'db' as the db name
    #
    #  InfluxDB::Client.new 'db'
    #
    #  # override username, other defaults remain unchanged
    #
    #  InfluxDB::Client.new username: 'username'
    #
    #  # override username, use 'db' as the db name
    #  Influxdb::Client.new 'db', username: 'username'
    #
    # === Valid options in hash
    #
    # +:host+:: the hostname to connect to
    # +:port+:: the port to connect to
    # +:prefix+:: the specified path prefix when building the url e.g.: /prefix/db/dbname...
    # +:username+:: the username to use when executing commands
    # +:password+:: the password associated with the username
    # +:use_ssl+:: use ssl to connect
    # +:verify_ssl+:: verify ssl server certificate?
    # +:ssl_ca_cert+:: ssl CA certificate, chainfile or CA path.
    #                  The system CA path is automatically included
    # +:retry:: number of times a failed request should be retried. Defaults to infinite.
